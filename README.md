# PJT Sprite editor

### Made in 2019 in about 3 days, the code is a mess, I was hyperfixated on trying to make something like this

Made for my friend to ease his Vector Graphics shenanigans for their game: [itch.io](https://oshisaure.itch.io/puzzle-juggle-trouble)
Also was used in order to create a game in a game (Open Hexagon): [Dino Game Clone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnB_mIzd1xo)

## Features:
  - Add verts on existing edges.
  - Remove Verts.
  - Undo/Redo History.
  - Can move polygons around.
  - Saving into Lua table.
